<h1 id="finding-your-sources">Finding your sources</h1>
<p>Hello again!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm happy you came back, and now that you have your thesis <a href="https://github.com/PauloShinji/AST/blob/master/AST_Entry01.md">topic</a> (Gris 2018), it‚Äôs time to figure out how to write it!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EGwCR2w1QDNm0/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>Chill, don‚Äôt panic. Step by step ‚Äúpasito a pasito, suave suavecito‚Äù (Luis Fonsi 2017).</p>
<p>Before building an argument, we need to figure out how to get the information, and not just any information, the right information.(Machi e McEvoy 2016)</p>
<p>This entry starts with theoretical considerations - that will avoid problems with the committee evaluating the thesis -, and shows (pragmatically) a package of tools to help finding the sources.</p>
<h2 id="theory-stuff-or-‚Äúhow-to-make-your-supervisor-proud‚Äù">Theory Stuff (or, ‚Äúhow to make your supervisor proud‚Äù)</h2>
<h3 id="primary-vs-secondary-sources">Primary vs Secondary sources</h3>
<p>Primary vs Secondary choices!? Ohh, not again‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcmmv7jqdvy2SE8/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>But why do people talk so much about it? It must have <em>some</em> importance.</p>
<p><em><strong>It does.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary sources</strong> are pretty much the <strong>‚Äúobject‚Äù</strong> of your thesis. So, if you are studying the Wealth of Nations, the <em>book</em> is your primary source. All other books on the matter will be tools to understand that one book. (Eco et al. 2015)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well that is piece of cake üç∞ if you study literature. But what is you want to study Decolonisation‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ we warned you in the last <a href="https://github.com/PauloShinji/AST/blob/master/AST_Entry01.md">post</a> to narrow that you should narrow your topic for a reason!</p>
<p>So a more feasible topic would be ‚ÄúThe discourses of Patrice Lumumba in the independence of Congo‚Äù, and his speeches would be a primary source.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The secondary sources</strong> would include <em>all</em> the materials you use to understand his views, like newspapers, reports, books with theories of decolonisation, etc. (Eco et al. 2015)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, things are not <em>that</em> simple ‚Äì things are never simple in social sciences üò≠. Each discipline will probably vary a little in this aspect. But if you got the general idea, adjusting the edges with your supervisor will be easy.</p>
<h2 id="practical-stuff">Practical Stuff</h2>
<p>Ok, we all heard the metaphor that we are throwing nets in the sea to fish for information.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/kTZBUjdRlZB3G/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>But we need to be smart about it. üéì</p>
<p>If you walk in a dissertation without your primary source, you are probably in for <em><strong>big</strong></em> trouble.</p>
<p>But even if you miss a relatively important piece of secondary source, you will probably be fried by the committee examining your work ‚Äì specially if you missed something one of them wrote about the topic. üí©</p>
<p>So how do you make sure you don‚Äôt have this kind of problems?</p>
<p>Use the right tools.</p>
<p>You want to make your search as broad and as precise as possible.</p>
<p>So</p>
<h3 id="be-precise">Be precise</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Talk to a specialist</strong>. You write about Conflict in urban settings, go ask Oliver for advice on bibliography to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the bibliography of good works</strong> generally, good stuff is written using good stuff. Go to the bibliography part of a text you like (yes, that in the end the we always ignore) and see things that are related to something you want to know more about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Filter your searches</strong>. This is particularly good in google. Use the tools to make sure you are only searching for papers/media/stuff published in the right period. And update your <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar profile</a>! This will help the algorithm to get what you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="be-broad">Be broad</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use different engines and databases</strong>. Almost everyone knows <a href="https://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a>, but that are loads of different databases, and most specialized topics have one of their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines">decent compilation</a></p>
<p>Now, you used all these tools, found <em>that</em> key article without which your thesis will be forever incomplete.</p>
<p>But the article is paid. You hit a <strong>paywall</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/duzKOeDAytSwlsXtpAKRdFLB_y9I__9okhyl8uylLPD6o_T_CR75x0X0ovZHMm9SzxMpZDDpk_o" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/uCLrqp14d6JH2/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>Well‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="get-around-the-pay-wall">Get around the pay wall!!!</h2>
<p>How?</p>
<p>With these tools, of course!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://kopernio.com/">Kopernio</a></strong> and **<a href="http://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a> **</li>
</ul>
<p>(Ltd [s.d.]), (‚ÄúUnpaywall‚Äù [s.d.])</p>
<p>This shows you if you have a way to access the given article for free. And this is legal!</p>
<p>All you have to do is click on the links above and install</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A9D8Uin-khVUblO41sxeHLngrqJMjWehO6lWhym2AOwol9IogWClyc6KOvX97ovpGw5edNZ_ndc" alt="Kopernio"></p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/99ZuEwmI9ec6pLK26nSWy_SMjZOk5zsPpzvQ9IfKzgyvDXPaCUbebkrRxkwruMULZCnfxMrTFUs" alt="Unpaywall"></p>
<p>And now your own browser shows you if you have access to the article, with only one click.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lc-Ig48x8oNqh1JR_LNbdGIkhnzuIkHeqRe4uINJJCbVPE5Z7zcAer23Ji917J2E0qT8o_VpLxM" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p><strong>Of course, sometimes even that isn‚Äôt enough.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/L95W4wv8nnb9K/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In those cases, some people resort to <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/">Sci-Hub</a> and <a href="http://libgen.io">LibGen</a></strong>*</li>
</ul>
<p>To use <strong>Sci-Hub</strong>, you have to copy the COI of the article you want</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IMD0ogOiQQGDfTylnyLZekAlDTzlD2jnei4dLiLIMkJW5Iwipf78ADEj9EaX4AS6ifMbN31XGQc" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Then you paste the COI to Sci-Hub</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9_L0ioPRcAGUNKda5TTvNrsJJhxVO-SPi96hPwBorfIWp6uhIjX63os1N-KPzQXJrBTHcI43k8M" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>This window will show, and you click on the name of the article</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rixdRhsWYW5-6FrsMf00yuoAiEKC7hW-HQJ4wj9V3Qeruc2YmINiIvsglmQN_HuR-vcISQF0CO0" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>After that, you only have to click in ‚Äúget‚Äù</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NK_M4G8ob8IOb9fXM6ZBJdNuFo9auDl3JfoiSwbDwuFjqqF1vPbydDSKGUZdbGYEMycqfLlYpXg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Or you can use libgen</p>
<p>To do it you have to find the book‚Äôs isbn and past it to the libgen searcher. Mark ‚ÄúISBN‚Äù in the session ‚ÄúSearch in Fields‚Äù</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4_bEv0o27mVf1hBlS_llq_s2q0co8PPY4sQgDEZSeDyvUJvObe2mrTdrjgXiVFuWQocmd0JgdiY" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Click on the title</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fogvzT7ZIMesVcfNsOe-iS335OVD453k7ZkL1aUxxAs0flykD2wSZ4631RIA_SCH5ub8mqNsve4" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>And follow the same procedure as before with Sci-Hub.</p>
<p>Not that I would know. I have never used such ways, but I thought I ought to share the knowledge.</p>
<p>One more quick thing. And it is something that I <strong>do not</strong> recommend. <em>But</em> If you spoke with your supervisor and you are researching in more tense topics ‚Äì such as the Daesh ‚Äì and both of you agreed to dig deeper, you will some point end up in the dark web.</p>
<p>The browser to navigate there is called TOR, and I insist you speak to responsible people before diving too deep. Furthermore, TOR is illegal in some countries, so be smart about it!</p>
<p>That being said, there is no harm in experimenting some anonymous search, so if that makes you curious, let us know and I can help you with the first steps.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sorry, today‚Äôs entry was a bit too long. But you made it!!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohfFDPhabUskDp67e/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>I hope that with these tools you will be able to find all the articles you need for your thesis and your papers.</p>
<p>Now what you gotta do is sit in a comfortable position</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11JTxkrmq4bGE0/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p><strong>And start using those tools.</strong></p>
<p>Because it takes time to find good databases, and a tool is only as good as the person using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/IelxugxenjdyU/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>Therefore, do not be afraid to search like crazy, as long as you are focused.</p>
<p>Finally, you may have noticed that we did not talk about interviews or production of statistics. It is true. Future entries will cover your role as an active actor in the production of data, but not this one.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll show how to filter what‚Äôs important and how to organize it properly.</p>
