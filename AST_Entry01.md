<h2 id="how-to-choose-a-topic">How to choose a topic</h2>
<h3 id="welcome">Welcome!</h3>
<p>We welcome you to the start of our common journey. I believe that the first steps into the unknown are more a matter of guts than of skills. Even so, having some skills can bring out the necessary courage ‚Äì and end the excuses ‚Äì to start.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/oj2GhTqAIoNIk/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>We have made a certain compilation of commonly referred texts on how to choose a topic, you can see the list below. We looked at Ivy League blogs, classic books, and the forefront of academic knowledge. Mostly, they share the same formula. Your topic must be something you love, and it has to be workable. Honestly, ending the AST_Entry01 here would cover 50% of what is out there. But we are not most sites and we need to justify our budget ‚Äì just kidding, we don‚Äôt have a budget üòÖüí∏.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs unpack what is a workable thesis first.</p>
<p>Also, the Academic Support Team would like to make one thing clear: these are recurrences, they are <strong>not</strong> rules.</p>
<h2 id="a-workable-thesis-is">A workable thesis is:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well delimited</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Brief History of Time (Hawking, 1988) would probably receive a failing grade, had it not been written by Hawking. A work that is too broad is vulnerable to every sort of objection, I mean, how could a member of the committee resist the temptation to showcase his/her knowledge over a minor event absent from a student‚Äôs work? Be bold, but be humble.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to discuss ‚Äúviolence against women‚Äù, you can delimit one specific instrument that is helping combat it and analyse how is it working in practical means or not. How is it being well implemented or not. You know that your thesis will not be a final word on the matter, but should be meaningful and delimited to the constraints of efforts and time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capable of being completed in time</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Draw a realistic time table. Do not assume you will read post-colonial-econo-anthropology as fast as you read the Prisoner of Azkaban (and you won‚Äôt have a time-turner).</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EQ0Xz9qiN5x7y/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-colonialist</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This point comes from Eco‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow to write a thesis‚Äù, where he states that to have a workable thesis, you must understand the main languages related to it (so if you will write about Kant, you must know German).But he makes a notorious exception to ‚Äúnon-western languages‚Äù, so you could write about the Tunisian Revolution without knowing any arabic. <strong>We invite you to question his opinion</strong>!!! This is both an ideological and a pragmatic approach. However, if you are interested in ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, or if you <em>really</em> want to work in a theme that the core bibliography is in a language you don‚Äôt speak, have a look at the footnote.</p>
<p>Now a thesis that you love ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<h2 id="a-thesis-that-you-love-is">A thesis that you love is:</h2>
<p>Much harder to be put in bullet points. üòï</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let‚Äôs begin by saying that thesis have meanings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To say that a thesis you love is meaningful is pretty much part of a pep talk, because I believe that is quite obvious. One of the meanings of the thesis is that it is an outcome of two years of your life. Even with the expectation of a thesis by the end of your studies, your time here has many other meanings, and ideally, your topic will correspond to those meanings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A thesis you love is a thesis you are happy to include in you life story</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you talk about all the sh*t you‚Äôve been through; all your accomplishments, conquests, challenges and passions, if you don‚Äôt mention the topic of your thesis, you probably don‚Äôt love it. Choose something that made your eyes glow (?) when you talked about it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You found a topic you love beyond any questioning</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is something that touches your heart deeply. The perfect policy to cure all problems of the world,designed by someone you love with all your heart. Even better, it was created by your late grandfather. Then, in the middle of your thesis you discover dirt on the policy that directly implies the person you love, writing about it would bring a major quarrel in the centre of your family.</p>
<p>And then, because the topic involves someone you love so much, you have a nice conflict of interest to handle, and while suffering through the usual trials and tribulations of a normal thesis.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/ca7b53444c251cb9077262df94c16238/tenor.gif?itemid=9335496" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>So maybe you want to think about that. AND DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE TOPIC</p>
<p>It is worth saying that a thesis that is only a compilation of flyers and propaganda isn‚Äôt much of a thesis either. Putting in Eco‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúA politician who approves a development plan without sufficient information on the community‚Äôs situation is simply a fool, if not a criminal‚Äù. Similarly, one can betray their agenda by writing a political thesis that lacks scientific rigor.</p>
<p>This is not to say that your topic cannot be politically engaged, but it has to be responsibly engaged.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After reading these 700 words, you already have your topic figured out, right?!</p>
<p>Sh*t? No?!</p>
<p>üôÄ</p>
<p>Of course that‚Äôs normal. Many people change their topic over and over. What is important is have a general idea</p>
<p>So you have to sit down and put one word after the other.</p>
<p>It is that easy and that hard.</p>
<p>So you write</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/o0vwzuFwCGAFO/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>And write</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11xBk5MoWjrYoE/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>And when you think you got it, go talk to someone (a friend, your supervisor, or the AST)</p>
<p>And things might change a little</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/e7MM7D8ff8LVC/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>And this is good. That is how you acquire the skills you need to be a master.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MbkDUSk5QW98s/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>So our journey begins.</p>
<p>There are a few exercises and tips that we will show on Sunday that we hope will make the steps of the way easier and even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>AST</p>
