<h3 id="welcome">Welcome!</h3>
<p>We welcome you to the start of our common journey. I believe that the first steps into the unknown are more a matter of guts than of skills. Even so, having some skills can bring out the necessary courage – and end the excuses – to start.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/oj2GhTqAIoNIk/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>We have made a certain compilation of commonly referred texts on how to choose a topic, you can see the list below. We looked at Ivy League blogs, classic books, and the forefront of academic knowledge. Mostly, they share the same formula. Your topic must be something you love, and it has to be workable. Honestly, ending the AST_Entry01 here would cover 50% of what is out there. But we are not most sites and we need to justify our budget – just kidding, we don’t have a budget 😅💸.</p>
<p>Let’s unpack what is a workable thesis first.</p>
<p>Also, the AST would like to make one thing clear: these are recurrences, they are <strong>not</strong> rules.</p>
<h2 id="a-workable-thesis-is">A workable thesis is:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not too ambitious</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Brief History of Time (Hawking, 1988) would probably receive a failing grade, had it not been written by Hawking. A work that is too broad is vulnerable to every sort of objection, I mean, how could a member of the committee resist the temptation to show the knowledge over a minor event absent from a student’s work? And be bold, but be humble. If you want to work a topic of the peace among nations, know that your thesis will not be a final word on the matter. Maybe you would like to discuss the topic under a certain light, such as the concept of Peace in the UN Charter. (Eco, 2015).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Something you are - well - a <em>master</em> of</strong> 🎓</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose a specific topic. Dig deep enough to <em>master</em> material unknown to the committee. This is not a cheap trick (it may be a trick, but it takes so much work, that it is certainly not cheap). You will show yourself to be an expert among experts. And remember, you are doing a thesis, not writing an encyclopedia. You want to delve in arguments and build a case, not simply compile a list of readings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capable of being completed in time</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Draw a realistic time table. Do not assume you will read post-colonial-econo-anthropology as fast as you read the Prisoner of Azkaban (and you won’t have a time-turner).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not colonialist</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This point comes from Eco’s “How to write a thesis”, he says that to have a workable thesis, you must understand the main languages related to it (so if you will write about Kant, you must know German), but he makes a notorious exception to “non-western languages”, so you could write about the Tunisian Revolution without knowing any arabic. <strong>We strongly invite you to question his opinion</strong>!!! This is both an ideological and a pragmatic approach. However, if you are interested in “why”, or if you <em>really</em> want to work in a theme that the core bibliography is in a language you don’t speak, have a look at the footnote.</p>
<p>Now a thesis that you love ❤️</p>
<h2 id="a-thesis-that-you-love-is">A thesis that you love is:</h2>
<p>Much harder to be put in bullet points. 😕</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let’s begin by saying that thesis have meanings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To say that a thesis you love is meaningful is coaching work, because I believe that is quite obvious. One of the meanings of the thesis is that it is an outcome of two years of your life, from the second you stepped in your grad school, that is what has been expected of you - no pressure.</p>
<p>But more than that,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A thesis you love is a thesis you are happy to include in you life story</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you talk about all the sh*t you’ve been through. All your accomplishments, conquests, challenges and passions, if you don’t mention the topic of your thesis, you probably don’t love it. Choose something you will be glad to show to the world you worked with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>So you think you found a topic you love</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is something that touches your heart deeply. The perfect policy to cure all problems of the world, designed by someone you love with all your heart. Then, in the middle of your thesis you discover dirt on the policy that directly implies the person you love.</p>
<p>And now you have a nice conflict of interest to handle in the middle of your thesis.</p>

<p>So maybe you want to think about that.</p>
<p>It is worth saying that a thesis that is only a compilation of flyers and propaganda isn’t much of a thesis either. Putting in Eco’s words: “A politician who approves a development plan without sufficient information on the community’s situation is simply a fool, if not a criminal. Similarly, one can betray his political party by writing a political thesis that lacks scientific rigor”.</p>
<p>This is not to say that your topic cannot be politically engaged, but it has to be responsibly engaged.</p>
