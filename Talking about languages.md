<h1 id="languages-and-thesis">Languages and Thesis</h1>
<p>Umberto Eco, in “How to write a thesis”[1], is clear about the need to speak another language if you are referring a foreign author or topic.</p>
<p>He says that if you do not speak a different language, you should use your Masters to learn them. So he mentions reasons why one <strong>needs</strong> to speak the languages used in the thesis, the most relevant at the moment being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>the need to seek bibliographical sources in different languages</strong> as some things are probably not yet translated if you are researching something new. You can end up with very limited sources if your thesis is about Xi Jinping new policies and you do not speak Mandarin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>** untranslatable aspects**, as "learning a new language is like gaining a new soul”. Think about “security” and “safety”, in Spanish, they are both “seguridad”. If you are writing about Security in Buenos Aires, and you do not know of this difference, your thesis might be seriously compromised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But he makes an exception for “non-western languages”.</p>
<p>We recommend a careful approach. This smells of colonialism.</p>
<p>Not only will your thesis be subjected to the same issues Eco previously mentioned, but it will be also more politically vulnerable to critics. - And I tend to agree with the critics, in this case, but that’s my opinion.</p>
<p>That being said, this approach can be rather elitist. A masters is an expensive adventure, and many of us do not have the time or the means to learn another language.</p>
<p>While it is relatively easy to learn Arabic or Chinese in Geneva, learning Quechua or Xhosa can be a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>To deal with this issue, Diniz[2] suggests a few possible strategies on your topic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Try to avoid themes that require a cutting-edge literature review. Instead of looking at the latest developments in Merkel’s policies, try to see what Bismarck did under a certain scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for topics in languages you know. Maybe you want to see your country’s reaction to Xi Jinping’s policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for themes that many people in your language write. Make it clear that this is but one perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deeper you go on your empiric research and your own data, the better you can deal with the lack of another language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, it truly depends on your topic, your methods and your values. Because it is your dissertation, and no one else’s.</p>
